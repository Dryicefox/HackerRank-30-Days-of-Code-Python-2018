i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
o = 8
a = 4.0
f = 'is the best place to learn and practice coding!'
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
o = int(input())
a = float(input()) ###Python is dynamically typed, so we just need to ensure that what we are receiving is a float so it can keep the property of decimal.
f = input()
# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+o)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(a+d)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(s+f)
